 * Advantage

    It limits subclassing. A mediator localizes behavior that otherwise would be distributed among several objects. Changing this behaviour requires subclassing Mediator only, Colleague classes can be reused as is.

Disadvantage

    It centralizes control. The mediator pattern trades complexity of interaction for complexity in the mediator. Because a mediator encapsulates protocols, it can become more complex than any individual colleague. This can make the mediator itself a monolith thatâ€™s hard to maintain
